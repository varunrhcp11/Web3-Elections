# Web3-Elections

This is a simple example of creating a voting system system using Solidity, Truffle Suit and React.js. 

# Credits 
The example is based off a tutorial provided by Dapp University (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3681ZYbDSSk).
Minor changes and updates were made to keep the dapp up-to-date



# How to use 

First you will need to ensure that you have all the dependencies required 
```
npm install
```
Once, all dependencies have been installed, we can migrate the contracts using 
```
truffle migrate --reset
```
After the Contracts have succussfully been migrated onto your local chain you are ready to interact with the contracts using the front end developed. 
To access this, you will need to run the front end application using 
```
npm run dev
```
